üåü Overview

This IoT-based wildlife tracking system enables researchers and conservationists to monitor animal movements, health parameters, and environmental conditions in real-time. The system utilizes low-power devices attached to animals that transmit data to a central base station, which then processes and visualizes the information through a web-based dashboard.

 ‚ú® Features

- Real-time GPS Tracking: Precise location monitoring with configurable update intervals
- Health Parameter Monitoring: Track body temperature, activity levels, and other vital signs
- Low Power Design: Optimized for extended battery life with solar charging capabilities
- Long-range Communication: Utilizes LoRaWAN technology for communication in remote areas
- Data Visualization: Interactive web dashboard for analyzing animal movement and health trends
- Alert System: Configurable notifications for unusual behavior or health anomalies
- Geofencing: Virtual boundaries with alerts for animal movement outside designated areas

 üèó System Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

1. Tracking Devices: Wearable collars/tags with sensors and communication modules
2. Base Stations: Fixed stations that receive data from tracking devices
3. Web Dashboard: Cloud-based platform for data visualization and analysis
